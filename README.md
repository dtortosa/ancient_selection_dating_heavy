# **Heavy analyses of the project about signals of climate adaptation**

This repository includes scripts to estimate signals of adaptation across human populations and model their association with protential drivers of adaptation. We developed a new modeling framework to compare a battery of algorithms (from linear models to deep neural networks) and select the best to model adaption signals across 26 human populations in 4 continents.

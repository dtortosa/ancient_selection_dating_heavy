# **Heavy analyses of the project about signals of climate adaptation**

This repository includes pipelines performed within singularity containers.

The list of metabolic genes used here was obtained in other repo: [dtortosa/ancient_selection_dating.git](https://github.com/dtortosa/ancient_selection_dating). These analyses are in different repos because I created in different directories. The iHS calculation and modeling was done within singularity containers, which only works in my linux partition, not in my windows partition where all my data, including the confounding factors, is.

# **Heavy analyses of the project about signals of climate adaptation**

This repository includes scripts to estimate signals of adaptation across human populations and model their association with protential drivers of adaptation. To achieve that, we develop a new modeling framework to compare a battery of algorithms and select the best to model adaption signals across 26 human populations.

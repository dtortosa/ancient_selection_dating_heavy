# **Heavy analyses of the project about signals of climate adaptation**

This repository includes pipelines performed within singularity containers.

The list of metabolic genes used here was obtained in other repo: [dtortosa/ancient_selection_dating.git](https://github.com/dtortosa/ancient_selection_dating). These analyses are in different repos because I created in different directories. The analyses of this repo are done within singularity containers, which only works in my linux partition, not in my windows partition.

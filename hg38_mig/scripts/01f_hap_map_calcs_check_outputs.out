###### create array with all combinations of pops and chromosomes ######

## get pop and chromosome names ##
we are going to analyze 26 pops and 22 chromosomes?
True
See them
['GBR' 'FIN' 'CHS' 'PUR' 'CDX' 'CLM' 'IBS' 'PEL' 'PJL' 'KHV' 'ACB' 'GWD'
 'ESN' 'BEB' 'MSL' 'STU' 'ITU' 'CEU' 'YRI' 'CHB' 'JPT' 'LWK' 'ASW' 'MXL'

## get all the combinations but first make a dummy example ##

# dummy example to get all possible combinations of two lists #
['marbella_1', 'marbella_2', 'marbella_3', 'cuzco_1', 'cuzco_2', 'cuzco_3', 'granada_1', 'granada_2', 'granada_3']
Do we have all dummy combinations?
True

# get all combinations from the actual pops and chromosomes #
Do we have all combinations of chromosomes and populations?
True
is this equivalent to itertools.product?
True

## get pop and chromosome names ##
we are going to analyze 26 pops and 22 chromosomes?

## get all the combinations but first make a dummy example ##

# dummy example to get all possible combinations of two lists #
['marbella_1', 'marbella_2', 'marbella_3', 'cuzco_1', 'cuzco_2', 'cuzco_3', 'granada_1', 'granada_2', 'granada_3']
Do we have all dummy combinations?
True

# get all combinations from the actual pops and chromosomes #
Do we have all combinations of chromosomes and populations?
True
is this equivalent to itertools.product?
True

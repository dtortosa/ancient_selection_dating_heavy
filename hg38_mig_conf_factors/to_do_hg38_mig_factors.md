- Gene IDs
    - We are going to get IDs for HG38
    - you have to check whether the gene symbols of gene sets (BAT connectome, thermogenic genes and VIPs) are in our list
    - I think msigdb (considered for thermogenic genes) was indeed in hg38 but we remove genes without gene symbols in our hg19 list, so we should do it again.
